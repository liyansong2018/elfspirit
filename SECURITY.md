ELFSPIRIT itself is a tool, and it is inevitable that there are some bugs and security vulnerabilities. Since elfspirit is mainly for the convenience of Security Researcher, we have a stricter definition of security vulnerabilities here.

**We only mark vulnerabilities that can be truly exploited as security issues.  `elfspirit` tool is not expected to be used with untrusted executables.**

In any case, we welcome issue and PR!
