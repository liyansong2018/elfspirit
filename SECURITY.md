ELFSPIRIT functions as a tool, and like any tool, it may contain occasional bugs and security vulnerabilities. Given its primary utility for Security Researchers, we uphold a rigorous standard when identifying security vulnerabilities.

Our classification of security issues is stringent, focusing solely on vulnerabilities that have the potential for real-world exploitation. It is advised not to employ the elfspirit tool with untrusted executables.

We encourage the community to report issues and submit pull requests for continual improvement. Your contributions are highly valued and appreciated!
